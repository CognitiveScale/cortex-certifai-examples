    "As expected the 'unaware' model improves in fairness on the 'aware' one, but still displays significant bias compared to the by-construction fair predictor.  This shows that simply removing a model's direct access to a feature can be helpful, but is far from a panacea.  In particular in this case we can see that bias on marital status remains within the confidence interval of the 'aware' model."
