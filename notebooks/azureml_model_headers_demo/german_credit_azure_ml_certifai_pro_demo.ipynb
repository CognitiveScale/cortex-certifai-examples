    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cortex Certifai Pro is a single user version of Cortex Certifai that runs on an Azure VM and can be installed from the Azure Marketplace.  Certifai enables data scientists to define, scan, and analyze ML models to evaluate their fairness, robustness, and explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certifai Pro VMs run scans on ML models with the aid of the Certifai Toolkit, a downloadable set of Python packages and CLI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "​You can find more details about Certifai on the official [documentation site](https://cognitivescale.github.io/cortex-certifai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "​This tutorial helps users of Azure Machine Learning resources (hosted notebooks/models/endpoints) setup their models and ready them for scanning with Certifai Pro.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it walks you through using the Certifai Python API to create scan definitions that can be passed to a Certifai Pro instance along with datasets and secrets (if needed)."

    "This notebook-tutorial takes you through the following processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing Certifai Pro in an Azure cloud environment and configuring your Certifai Pro instance with storage parameters for a pre-existing container in an Azure Storage Account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Installing the required Certifai Toolkit python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Obtaining credentials for Azure-hosted model endpoint services for sklearn models by following the [\"Azure ML Certifai Scan\" notebook](https://github.com/CognitiveScale/cortex-certifai-examples/blob/master/notebooks/azureml_model_headers_demo/german_credit_azure_ml_demo.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Testing the deployed hosted model endpoint services (webservices).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Installing Cortex Certifai Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Configure Certifai CLI with connection details for Certifai Pro VM\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Constructing Certifai scan definitions for a binary classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Uploading the required datasets for the scan into the Azure storage account container configured for Certifai Pro (in Step 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Submitting a remote scan job to the Certifai Pro instance through the Certifai CLI using the scan definition (constructed in Step 6)."

    "The installation process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the Certifai Pro Azure  Marketplace subscription and VM instantiation.\n",
    "- Configure your Certifai Pro instance with blob storage containers and credentials for an Azure Storage account.\n",
    "- You may also install sample reports for a variety of usecases in Finance, Healthcare and Insurance to understand how the AI Trust Index scores generated by Certifai.\n",
    "- Configure Custom SSL certificates (if needed)\n",
